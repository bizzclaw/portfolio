          <p>This site is meant of a simple means to showcase my past, current and upcoming works.</p>
          <p>This site was made using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. <a href="https://github.com/bizzclaw/portfolio-site">Check it out on github.</a></p>
          <p>I've been coding since 2013 where I started by dabbling with lua in Garry's Mod. Since them, I've been practicing coding constantly, working on various projects and even slowly expanding out of lua in to other languages</p>
          <p>Its my goal to get in to game development, either working at an established stufio, or starting my own. I'm especially interested in Virtual Reality (VR), because designing and developing for VR is completely new. It's the new frontier of game development, and I can't wait to be a part of it.</p>
