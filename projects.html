          <h2>Gplacer</h2>
          <h4>Langueage: Lua</h4>
          <p>Gplacer is a level design tool for the source engine, it was developed as an alternative to placing "props" in the world using hammer.</p>
          <p>The tool allows level designers to load in to an instance of the engine, spawn props and manipulate them with ease in a physical environment, as opposed to th static nature of the defalt source engine level editor.</p>
          <p><strong>Gplacer is Open Source</strong>, check out it's <a href="https://github.com/bizzclaw/gplacer">Github Page</a></p>

          <h2>Gmod Resurgence</h2>
          <h4>Languages: Lua, MySQL</h4>
          <p>Garrysmod is a freeform sandbox game based on the source engine.</p>
          <p>Released in 2004, the Garrysmod community is still active, both in terms of players and developers. Garrysmod is unique in that it can be transformed in to a completely different game through it's lua implementation. Thanks to this, it's a very easy platform to build off of.</p>
          <p>I have been tinkering with Garrysmod lua for the past four years, more or less teaching myself how to code by persueing projects in garrysmod. One of my most ambitious undertakings is "Resurgence", a sort of multiplayer approach to the Fallout game series.</p>
          <p>While most Garrysmod developers build upon an established framework, Resurgence was built from the ground up, meaning that both the backend and frontend code for Persistent inventory, items and character profiles all had to be written from scratch.</p>
          <p>Rsurgence is still in active development, and has been since summer of 2016. While much of the items, writing and balancing has been done by a dedicated team of volunteers who work with me, all of the systems designed to do things with that information has been developed by me alone.</p>
          <p>Resurgence uses art assets from games developed by Bethesda Game Studios, these assets are allowed to be used granted that no profit is being made off of their distribution, they are from a legitimatecopy of the game, and they are in good tastes.</p>
          <p><strong>Resurgence is not yet open source</strong>, however, a summary of the current progress and goals of resurgence can be found on it's <a href="https://trello.com/b/EKAN0qfQ/resurgence">Trello Page</a>.</p>
